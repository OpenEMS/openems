= Rest Remote Communication

    This Bundle allows the communication with Remote Components/Channels of another OpenEMS via REST.
    You can read from Channels and react to them as well as write into those Channels.
    You need to activate this Bridge with Configurations and then activate a Component as a Rest Remote device read/write.
    Atm it only provides the ability to read and write to ONE Channel per configured rest remote device.
