== TimerManager 

Access to different kind of timers. Can be used to 

* `timerManager.getTimerByCount()` - count each call to the timer.  
* `timerManager.getTimerByCoreCycles()` - count each core cycle.
* `timerManager.getTimerByTime()` - count a given time in seconds.


=== Usage Example 

[source,java]
----
@Reference 
TimerManager timerManager;

Timer countTimer;
Timer countTimer2;
Timer timeTimer;
Timer cyclesTimer;

activate() {
    //counts down on each call of countTimer.check()
    countTimer        = timerManager.getTimerByCount( 104 );                             

    //counts down on each call to countTimer.check(), but has an initial start delay, 
    //helpful for e.g. heatpumps
    countTimer2       = timerManager.getTimerByCount( 104, config.getStartDelay() );
	
	//counts down on each core cycle
    coreCyclesTimer   = timerManager.getTimerByCoreCycles(100 );
              		     
	//counts down seconds from now
    oneMinTimer       = timerManager.getTimerByTime( 120 );
                                   
    //counts down seconds, writes state of timer to the given channel
    twoMinTimer       = timerManager.getTimerByTime( this.channel, 180 );            
}

doSomething() {
    if(oneMinTimer.check()){
        // do stuff ...
        oneMinTimer.reset();
    }

    if(oneMinTimer.checkAndReset()){
        // do stuff ...
        //no need to reset the timer 
    }
}

== Implementation Hints

* Timer relevant actions in OpenEMS typically depends on the running context. Therefore the timer 
is implemented as synchronous function interface and does not provide asynchrounous callbacks. 
  
* Count timers and time timers are simple utility classes. Nevertheless this package 
is designed as singleton OpenEMS component. Reason are the core cycle timers. This reduces
 coding expenses within the concrete implementations.
