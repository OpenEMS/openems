= Similarday-Model Predictor

This predictor uses "Similar day technique" for prediction. 
This particular implementation requires mainly two inputs, which are
* Num of past weeks (n)
* The channels address data, which needs to predicted.


 
 
The similar-day models predicts by calculating the average of a 'n' number of previous period values.

_example_: the next monday predictions values is equal to average of past n = 4 monday values.

This predictor is mainly used for predicting the Consumption power and energy. And the Accuracy of the model is scientifically verified within https://openems.io/research/emsig/[EMSIG project^].
