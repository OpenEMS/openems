= Time-Of-Use Tariff ENTSO-E

This implementation uses the ENTSO-E transparency platform to receive day-ahead prices in European power grids.

To request a (free) authentication token, please see chapter "2. Authentication and Authorisation" in the official API documentation: https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html#_authentication_and_authorisation

Prices retrieved from ENTSO-E are subsequently converted to the user's currency (defined in Core.Meta Component) using the Exchange Rates API.
