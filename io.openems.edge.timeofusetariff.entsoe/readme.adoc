= Time-Of-Use Tariff ENTSO-E

This implementation uses the ENTSO-E transparency platform to receive day-ahead prices in European power grids.

To request a (free) authentication token, please see chapter "1.5. How to get security token" in the official API documentation: https://transparencyplatform.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12845911031188-How-to-get-security-token

Prices retrieved from ENTSO-E are subsequently converted to the user's currency (defined in Core.Meta Component) using the Exchange Rates API.

For detailed information about the Exchange Rates API, please refer to: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html
