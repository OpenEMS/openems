= Levl Controller for ESS Balancing

This is a beta version.

This controller combines the optimization of self-consumption with flexibility trading by levl.
Note: This controller can only be used in combination with an optimization contract with Levl Energy. For contact und more information please visit https://levl.energy

== How it works
This controller receives charging and discharging instructions from Levl Energy and executes these taking into account local optimization and various constraints (such as SoC, grid limits, etc.).

== Requirements
The following components are required to use this controller successfully:
- Contract with Levl Energy for system optimization 
- ManagedSymmetricEss - a controllable energy storage system
- ElectricityMeter - a meter at the grid connection point

== Further information
Detailed information on self-consumption optimization can be found in the OpenEMS source code.
