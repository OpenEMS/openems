= ESS Delayed Sell-To-Grid

Controls an energy storage system so, that it delays the sell-to-grid power e.g. of a photovoltaics system. 

It charges the battery, when sell-to-grid power exceeds the configured "Sell-To-Grid power limit" 
and discharges when sell-to-grid power is falling below "Continuous Sell-To-Grid power".
