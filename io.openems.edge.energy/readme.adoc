Implementations and Services for OpenEMS Energy Schedules.

To understand the functionality and terms used in this implementation, its helpful to refer to the Jenetics manual available at https://jenetics.io/.

= Terms

Following terms and relations to Jenetics are used:

== Mode

The Mode refers to a predefined operation mode of a OpenEMS Controller.
A Mode is represented in Jenetics as a `Gene`.

== Period

The Period refers to a space in time. A Period holds one Mode per OpenEMS Controller to define its operation mode within this period of time.
A Period is represented in Jenetics as an index within a `Genotype` of `Chromosome` s.

== Schedule

A Schedule refers to a set of multiple Periods.
A Schedule is represented in Jenetics as a `Genotype`.

== Optimization

A Optimization consists of multiple Schedules that are typically simulated within a 15-minutes period.
A Optimization is represented in Jenetics as a `Population`.

= Context and their Scopes

Energy Scheduler uses `Context` objects that hold information that is relevant to a certain Scope of an Optimization run.

OpenEMS Controllers use delegation to `EnergyScheduleHandler` objects to handle requirements of the Energy Scheduler.

== GlobalOptimizationContext (`goc`)

The GlobalOptimizationContext - commonly abbreviated as `goc` - is a Context that is valid throughout an entire Optimization. 
It's typically recreated once per 15-minutes.

Example data: 
- Prediction of Production and Consumption
- List of all Energy Schedulers
- Global Limits like a limited Grid power
- ...

== GlobalScheduleContext (`gsc`)

The GlobalScheduleContext - commonly abbreviated as `gsc` - is a Context that is valid for simulation of one Schedule.
It's typically recreated multiple times per second.

Example data:
- Initial Energy of an ESS at the start of a Period.

== ControllerOptimizationContext (`coc`)

The ControllerOptimizationContext - commonly abbreviated as `coc` - is a Context that is valid throughout an entire Optimization for one Controller/EnergyScheduleHandler.
It's typically recreated once per 15-minutes.


== ControllerScheduleContext (`csc`)

The ControllerScheduleContext - commonly abbreviated as `csc` - is a Context that is valid for simulation of one Schedule of one Controller/EnergyScheduleHandler.
It's typically recreated multiple times per second.
