= Similarday-Model Predictor

This predictor uses "Similar day technique" for prediction. 
This particular implementation requires mainly two inputs, which are

* Num of past weeks (n)
* The channels address data, which needs to predicted.


The Similarday-Model Predictor predicts same values as on same day in the previous weeks, e.g. the prediction for coming monday calculates the average of (n) previous monday's. 

This predictor is mainly used for predicting the Consumption power and energy. And the Accuracy of the model is scientifically verified within https://openems.io/research/emsig/[EMSIG project^].

**Note:** This predictor adds one hour offset for (n) weeks during time changeover (summertime -> wintertime and wintertime -> summertime).
