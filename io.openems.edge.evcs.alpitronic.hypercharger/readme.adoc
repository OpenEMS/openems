Implementation of the Alpitronic Hypercharger V1-X DC electric vehicle charging station.

** Alpitronic Hypercharger V1-X

== Additional application notes

The charging station comes with up to four physical connectors. This implementation is designed in a way, that each connector is represented by an individual OpenEMS Component. So if you have a Alpitronic with two connectors, please configure two "EVCS Alpitronic Hypercharger" with the `connector` configuration property set to `SLOT_0` and `SLOT_1` respectively.

Supported Firmware versions: `1.7.2` and higher.
