= Debug Log

Constantly shows the most important values of all Components on the console. This is often activated by default to be able to track the running system easily.

The 'most important values' are predefined by the individual OpenEMS Components. The configuration allows to

`additionalChannels`::
	add additional Channels to the log

`ignoreComponents`::
	ignore the output of certain Components

The priority of `additionalChannels` is higher than `ignoreComponents`, so an explicitly added Channel will be logged even if the Component has explicitly been ignored.
