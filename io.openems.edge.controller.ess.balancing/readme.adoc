= ESS Balancing

This controls a energy storage system in self-consumption optimization mode by trying to balance the power at the grid connection point, i.e.:
- charge the battery, when production is larger than consumption (i.e. when feeding power to the grid)
- discharge the battery, when consumption is larger than production (i.e. when buying power from the grid)

== Requirements

** ManagedSymmetricEss, a controllable energy storage system
** ElectricityMeter, a meter at the grid connection point

== Additional application notes

Above description assumes that the grid connection point should be balanced to `0 Watt`. This bevahiour is configurable using the `targetGridSetpoint` configuration parameter.
