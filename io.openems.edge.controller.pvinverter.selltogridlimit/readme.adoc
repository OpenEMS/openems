= PV-Inverter Sell-To-Grid limit

Dynamically limits the Sell-To-Grid power of a PV-Inverter to a defined maximum power.

If the configured mode is asymmetric, the controller evaluates the grid meter phase with the highest Sell-To-Grid power and curbs the PV-power of the configured PV-Inverter. 
The main purpose of the asymmetric mode is, to prevent the grid fuse from overcurrent.
