= ESS Grid Optimized Charge

Combination of the PredictiveDelayCharge and the SellToGridPowerLimit controllers:  

Delays the charging of the AC or DC storage system based on predicted production and consumption given by the PredictorManager.

Even during the delayed charging, the battery is able to force charge when the sell-to-grid power exceeds the configured "Sell-To-Grid maximum power limit".
This is mainly used when only 70 percent of the maximum production is allowed to feed in to the grid.
