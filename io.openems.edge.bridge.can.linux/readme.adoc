= CAN Bridge for Linux SocketCAN drivers

The "CAN OpenEMS bridge" provides a simple (single frame) raw CAN communication mechanism to 
* send and receive single CAN frame messages 
* directly map the appropriate data to OpenEMS channels (almost same mechanism as in the Modbus bridge).

This bundle is prepared to work with the Linux Kernel V5.x and V4.1x CAN Socket API.


== Dependencies

The "CAN OpenEMS bridge" depends on the libsocket-can-java git library project (see https://github.com/OpenEMS/libsocket-can-java/ for more information).
The library provides access to CAN hardware via generic linux SocketCAN API.   


== Notes
* the configuration allows to switch between a CAN simulation and a real CAN device 
* for more information have a look at the readme.adoc in io.openems.edge.bridge.can.common
