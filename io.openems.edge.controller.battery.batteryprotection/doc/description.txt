UNDEFINED: 		Undefined status is always reached when one of the values are undefined 
NORMAL: 		If no limit is reached this is the normal state
LIMIT:			If voltage or temperature limits are reached, charging or discharging will be denied 
FORCE_CHARGE:	If cell voltage or SoC is below a certain limit value, charging is forced
FULL_CHARGE:	If battery is not charged or discharged for a certain time period a full charge has to be done
CHECK:			If charging was forced, discharging is only allowed if SoC has increased
