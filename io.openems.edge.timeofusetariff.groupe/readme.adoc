= Time-Of-Use Tariff Groupe-E

This implementation uses the Groupe-E platform to receive day-ahead quarterly prices.

Prices retrieved from Groupe-E are subsequently converted to the user's currency (defined in Core.Meta Component) using the Exchange Rates API.

For detailed information about the Exchange Rates API, please refer to: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html
