= ESS Standby

Regularly checks the functionality of an ESS once per week while being in Standby mode.

Use-Case::
  In projects with Hochlastzeitfenster (HLZF) the storage system might not be used for some weeks or months. In these periods it is required to make a regular check of the system and to calibrate the battery. This controller automates this function.

Scheduling::
  The controller is supposed to be configured to run with less priority than "LimitTotalDischarge", "BatteryHandling",... and higher priority than "HLZF", "Balancing", "Peak-Shaving",...
