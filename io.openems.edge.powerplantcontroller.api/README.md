# Power-Plant-Controller API

Main goal of this new API is feed meter data AND power-plant-controller data to an OpenEMS controller. 
This controller shall e.g. balance an ESS and a PV-Inverter based on the measurements of the meter (API given) 
and setpoint specification of power-plant-controller (this API, had been missing).
