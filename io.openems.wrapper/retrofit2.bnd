# NOTE: At runtime Retrofit throws a not so nice warning:
#
# WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
# WARNING: Illegal reflective access by retrofit2.Platform (file:.../.gradle/caches/.../retrofit-2.11.0.jar) to constructor java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles$Lookup(java.lang.Class,int)
# WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of retrofit2.Platform
# WARNING: Use --illegal-access=warn to enable warnings of further illegal reflective access operations
# WARNING: All illegal access operations will be denied in a future release
#
# According to https://github.com/square/retrofit/issues/3341 this can be safely ignored.
# According to https://stackoverflow.com/a/61584378 there is an option to hide the warning
