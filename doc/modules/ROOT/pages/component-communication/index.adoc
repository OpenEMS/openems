This page describes the internal communication protocol between OpenEMS Edge, OpenEMS Backend and OpenEMS UI. The components keep an open https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket[Websocket] connection which is used for bi-directional communication. 

== JSON-RPC introduction

The protocol is based on https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification[JSON-RPC]. For details about JSON-RPC please refer to the specification. As a rough summary, the protocol is divided into

=== JSON-RPC Request

Identified by a unique ID and method name with specific params. Expects a Response.

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "method": "method",
  "params": {}
}
----

=== JSON-RPC Success Response

Referring to the ID of the Request, providing a result which can be empty or hold specific data.

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "result": {}
}
----

=== JSON-RPC Error Response

Referring to the ID of the Request, providing error code, message and optionally data.

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "result": {
    "code": number,
    "message": string,
    "data"?: {}
  }
}
----

=== JSON-RPC Notification

Identified by a unique method name with specific params. Does not expect a Response.

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "method",
  "params": {}
}
----

== Example communication messages

The information on this page is useful to understand the internal communication structure and can help if your plan is to replace one component by a custom implementation, e.g. implementing your own frontend application, or if you plan to extend the provided feature-set.

=== Subscribe Channels

Real-time channel data may change at a high rate. Instead of requiring the consumer to constantly pull the data, the OpenEMS API provides a publish-subscribe schema that notifies the consumer about updated values. It is initiated via a JSON-RPC request:

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "method": "subscribeChannels",
  "params": {
    "count": number,
    "channels": string[]
  }
}
----

The parameters for subscribing to channel data are:

- `count`: a request count value that needs to be increased on each request to avoid concurrency problems
- `channels`: a list of channel addresses as strings, e.g. "ess0/Soc", "ess0/ActivePower"

From then on, the API constantly keeps sending `currentData` JSON-RPC notifications, containing the data for all subscribed channels:
[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "currentData",
  "params": {
    [channelAddress]: string | number
  }
}
----

To unsubscribe from channels, a new `subscribeChannels` request has to be sent with an empty list of channels.

=== Edge-RPC

When using the API via OpenEMS Backend, it is possible to transparently target a specific OpenEMS Edge, that is connected to the Backend by wrapping the JSON-RPC request into an `Edge-RPC` request:

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "method": "edgeRpc",
  "params": {
    "edgeId": string,
    "payload": JSON-RPC-Request
  }
}
----

The parameters for an “edgeRpc” request are:

- `edgeId`: the unique ID of the Edge at the Backend
- `payload`: the JSON-RPC Request that should be forwarded to the Edge, e.g. `getEdgeConfig` or `updateComponentConfig`.

The JSON-RPC response then also wraps the original result as a payload:

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": UUID,
  "result": {
    "payload": JSON-RPC-Response
  }
}
----

===	JsonApi Component

To directly send a JSON-RPC request to one specific OpenEMS Component, that component has to implement the `JsonApi` interface.
Then the `componentJsonApi` request can be used to wrap a JSON-RPC request as payload:

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "UUID",
  "method": "componentJsonApi",
  "params": {
    "componentId": string,
    "payload": JSON-RPC-Request
  }
}
----

===	Edge-Config

The EdgeConfig may be retrieved using the following JSON-RPC method:

[source,json]
----
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "UUID",
  "method": "getEdgeConfig",
  "params": {}
}
----

== Communication schema

=== Authenticate UI to Edge/Backend using token

NOTE: On opening of the websocket connection to Edge/Backend, the UI is authenticated using an existing token.

=== Authenticate UI to Edge using password

=== Subscribe to Channels

NOTE: Allows a Component to subscribe on certain Channel values. The latest Channel values are then periodically sent.

=== Subscribe to System-Log

NOTE: Sends the log output of Edge to UI via Backend.
