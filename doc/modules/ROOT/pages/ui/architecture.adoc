== Adaptive User Interface

The OpenEMS UI is the standard user interface for OpenEMS.
It uses the `EdgeConfig` (see Edge -> Configuration) to adapt its visualisation in accordance with the actual configuration.
The screenshot above visualizes the 'Live view' of OpenEMS UI.
It shows Storage System, Production and Grid because corresponding OpenEMS Components are listed in the EdgeConfig.

== Configuration of OpenEMS Edge

OpenEMS UI provides a way to instantiate an OpenEMS Component from a factory by providing configuration parameters. See Edge -> Configuration for details.
