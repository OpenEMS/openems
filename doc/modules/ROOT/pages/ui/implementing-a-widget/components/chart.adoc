=== Creating a Chart

This chapter assumes that you already completed link:../introduction.html#_create_a_new_module_history_view[this].

Charts are mainly used in the History-View and should be acting like the `modal` in the live-view. This means they shouldn't be apparent in the history-view directly, but should open when clicking on a `flat-widget`.

Creating or updating charts has been very difficult, but if you use the recommended and new way of creating them, its much easier and can be done fast. Furthermore they are unittestable now. 

If we take a look at a link:src\app\edge\history\common\autarchy\chart\chart.ts[Working Example], we will see, that the chart directory includes not only the chart.ts but also the corresponding .spec-file. If you are not familiar with angulars unit testing, check it out link:https://angular.io/guide/testing#test-file-name-and-location[here].

NOTE: It is recommended to have the `component.ts` and `component.spec.ts` files in the same folder.

==== General

To understand how data is queried from the timeseries database, you need to know that there are some predefined time ranges link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/d6291452f01c2a370d722a50c884706c3121c529/ui/src/app/shared/service/defaulttypes.ts#L94[modes] for the chart. 

If you used the charts from time to time, you will notice that there are two visualisations. Bar and line chart. Line charts are used for day and week periods while bar charts are used for months and year. The custom period shows both, dependent on the selected period link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/d6291452f01c2a370d722a50c884706c3121c529/ui/src/app/edge/history/shared.ts#L290[(view resolution)]. The resolution, returned from this method is also used in the corresponding `Timeseries-Request`.

When using the link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/develop/ui/src/app/shared/jsonrpc/request/queryHistoricTimeseriesDataRequest.ts[QueryHistoricTimeseriesDataRequest], you should use the power-channels and for the link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/develop/ui/src/app/shared/jsonrpc/request/queryHistoricTimeseriesEnergyPerPeriodRequest.ts[QueryHistoricTimeseriesEnergyPerPeriodRequest] the energy-channels. You can read more about that link:https://openems.github.io/openems.io/openems/latest/backend/service.html#_timedata_aggregated_influxdb[here].


If you take a look link:ui\src\app\edge\history\common\autarchy\chart\chart.ts[here] you will notice that creating charts can be broken down to 2 main parts. The link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/develop/ui/src/app/shared/service/utils.ts#L646[input] and link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/d6291452f01c2a370d722a50c884706c3121c529/ui/src/app/shared/service/utils.ts#L648[output].

The input consists of this:

[source, js]
----
export type InputChannel = {

    /** Must be unique, is used as identifier in {@link ChartData.input} */
    name: string,
    powerChannel: ChannelAddress,
    energyChannel?: ChannelAddress

    /** Choose between predefined converters */
    converter?: (value: number) => number | null,
};
----


Here you define the channels that should be subscribed, it is mandatory to use a power channel, if no energy channel provided, you won't see the energy-value next to the legend-label. If no valid datapoint in the resulting data or no response exists, the link:https://openems.github.io/openems.io/openems/latest/backend/service.html#_timedata_aggregated_influxdb[dataset] won't be shown. You can also pass a converter. This enables mutating the data right away. For this you should either use one of the predefined link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/develop/ui/src/app/shared/genericComponents/shared/converter.ts[converters] or create your own.

The output callback gets this data and with it, you can define the link:https://github.com/OpenEMS/openems/blob/d6291452f01c2a370d722a50c884706c3121c529/ui/src/app/shared/service/utils.ts#L604[datasets]:

Lets get back to the link:src\app\edge\history\common\autarchy\chart\chart.ts[example].

TIP: When looking at the example when reading the following, it will be easier to follow.

For the `input` there are two channel-pairs used, additionally to the second, the data gets filter through a `converter` which filters in this case all null or negative values.
The `name` property is used to have a ID for using the data later.

The `output` is then defining the dataset, with the `nameSuffix` callback having the data of the `QueryHistoricTimeseriesEnergyRequest`, that has been called for the whole period, this means only one datapoint for the chosen period. If month or year are used as periods, there are always two of these requests. One for the `legend label` and the other for being displayed in the chart. 

The second one is passed with the output callback, and has to be used for the converter callback-function.

Additionally we define the formatting of the data in the tooltip and the yAxes.
