== General

* The OpenEMS Coding Guidelines are based on (and complement) the link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconventions-150003.pdf[Java Coding Convention].
* Limit pull requests to a small and closed topic.

== OpenEMS Edge & Backend

=== Java Code

* Limit Pull-Request to only one bundle/directory preferred
* Remove unnecessary console.logs
* Remove unnecessary empty lines
* Never use System.out.println()
* Fix all errors & warnings
* Use precise naming for methods/functions
* Use narrow scopes for variables; avoid class variables
* Split code in Interface, Implementation(..Impl) and Config files
* Use modern Java 17 syntax (e.g. 'var' keyword, streams, etc.)
* Add readme.adoc to a new bundle
* Review data in bnd.bnd file
* Format all files via Eclipse Autoformat, organize Imports, apply Checkstyle suggestions (see below)
* Avoid unnecessary comments on self explaining code
* Add comments to code that is difficult to understand
* Prefer functional programming (e.g. use Lambda expressions)
* Add JUnit tests.
* Run ./tools/prepare-commit.sh script

=== Tool support

While IntelliJ also works, Eclipse IDE is the officially supported development environment. It also provides tool support for guided assistance via bndtools.

.Eclipse Code formatter

Use `Eclipse [built-in]` Code Formatting Rules

 * Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Code Style -> Formatter -> ActiveProfile -> select -> `Eclipse [built-in]`
     
Before you commit files, run the Eclipse code formatter on each java source code file (Ctrl + Shift + F).

.Eclipse Checkstyle plugin

Use Eclipse checkstyle plugin `Eclipse-cs`. Install it with
  
* Eclipse -> Help -> Eclipse Marketplace -> Find -> `Eclipse-cs` -> Install 

Configure it with

* Eclipse -> Window -> Preferences -> New -> 
** Type: `Project Relative Configuration` 
** Name: `OpenEMS` 
** Location: `/cnf/checkstyle.xml`

Later set `OpenEMS` as default. Enable Checkstyle for every bundle you like in the Bndtools Explorer in the bundles context menu.      

== OpenEMS UI

=== TypeScript

* Act according to the rules above wherever it makes sense to do so. 

== Git-Flow workflow
* OpenEMS development follows the link:https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow[Git-Flow workflow].  
* Choose precise naming of pull request and its comments when making a pull request
* After opening the Pull-Request, review for yourself the actual changes line by line in the 'files' tab on Github. 
Ask for review only after you checked the actual changes again this way.  
* Ask for review when pull request is ready for review (not before)
 
*Note:* If you realize, that you added files accidentally, you can always reset them to the current 'develop' state with the command `git checkout develop <filename>`
