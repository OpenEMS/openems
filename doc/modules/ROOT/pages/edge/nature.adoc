Physical hardware is abstracted in OpenEMS Edge using _Natures_. A Nature defines a set of characteristics and attributes which need to be provided by each OpenEMS component that implements it. These characteristics are defined by Channels. For example an implementation of an `Ess` (Energy Storage System), needs to provide an `Soc`-Channel (State of charge of the battery).

Technically Natures are implemented as OSGi API Bundles.

Each .api bundle contains the nature interfaces that device implementations must implement. For example, io.openems.edge.ess.api defines interfaces like SymmetricEss, AsymmetricEss, ManagedSymmetricEss, etc. These are sub-natures of the Ess nature.

OpenEMS Edge provides the following types of Natures:

== Device Natures
e.g.:
- io.openems.edge.battery.api - Battery interfaces
- io.openems.edge.batteryinverter.api - Battery inverter interfaces
- io.openems.edge.ess.api - Energy Storage System interfaces
- io.openems.edge.evcs.api - EV Charging Station interfaces
- io.openems.edge.evse.api - EV Supply Equipment interfaces
- io.openems.edge.meter.api - Power meter interfaces
- io.openems.edge.pvinverter.api - PV inverter interfaces
- io.openems.edge.io.api - IO device interfaces
- io.openems.edge.heat.api - Heat pump interfaces
- io.openems.edge.thermometer.api - Thermometer interfaces

== Service/Support Natures
e.g.:
- io.openems.edge.controller.api - Controller interfaces
- io.openems.edge.scheduler.api - Scheduler interfaces
- io.openems.edge.timedata.api - Time-series data interfaces
- io.openems.edge.timeofusetariff.api - Dynamic pricing interfaces
- io.openems.edge.predictor.api - Forecasting interfaces
- io.openems.edge.weather.api - Weather service interfaces
- io.openems.edge.energy.api - Energy management interfaces
