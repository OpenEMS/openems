= ESS Delay Charge

This Controller delays full charing of an energy storage system (ESS) to a certain hour of the day. If for example configured to delay till 4 pm, the allowed charge power is limited in a way, that 100 % State-of-Charge is reached only at 4 pm. The Controller therefor constantly watches the remaining time and remaining capacity of the ESS.
