= Heater 

The heat sector is separated into different kind of Heaters.

Controllable heater devices - managed by operation mode.


*Note:* 

There are four different ways to control a ManagedHeater:

* controlled by electric production power - see _ManagedChp_.
* controlled by operation mode - see _ManagedHeaterByOperationMode_. 
* controlled by thermal heat power setpoint - planned to be added in the future.
* controlled by flow temperature setpoint - planned to be added in the future.
