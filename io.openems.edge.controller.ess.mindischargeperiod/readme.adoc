= ESS Minimum Discharge Period

Provides a minimum discharge power of the storage system for a configured time period, if a certain power peak has been reached.

This can be used in some systems where the allowed charge power has been set to zero and the storage needs a minimum discharge power for a certain time, to recognize that the storage is not full and the allowed charge power should be higher.
