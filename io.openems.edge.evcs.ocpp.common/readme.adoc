= Electric Vehicle Charging Station OCPP Common

The Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) is an application protocol for communication between
Electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) and a central management system.

The whole bundle contains a library of the OCPP functions.
It also provides a default abstract ocpp EVCS component that can be used by every specific charging station and a OcppServer interface that provides a minimum functionality, to be able to send data to a charging station.

Implemented Natures:
* Evcs (Electric Vehicle Charging Station
* MeasuringEvcs (Can get measured information)
