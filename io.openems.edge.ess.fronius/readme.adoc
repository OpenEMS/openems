= Fronius Symo GEN24

Implementation of the Fronius Symo GEN 24.

== Compatibility 

* Fronius Symo GEN 24

== Application Notes

The Fronius Symo GEN24 Modbus implementation seems to be buggy, it has sporadic artefacts and is not able to drive the battery seemlessly.
 
See comment in FroniusGen24EssImpl:applyPower():Line 236 for a detailed description.

=== Maturity

Production State: *-experimental-* 

Open Issues:

* Fronius Symo GEN24 can NOT be used with existing OpenEMS controllers. It can charge and discharge an attached battery. 
But due to a BUG in the Fronius Symo GEN24 hardware implementation it can not switch from charging to discharging without goint to 0 for a few seconds.
 
* backported and untested Version
