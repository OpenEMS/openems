= ESS Emergency Capacity Reserve

This Controller allows setting a `ReserveSoc` as the minimum State-Of-Charge that should be reached during normal on-grid operation, i.e. a energy storage system in self-consumption optimization mode will stop discharging at this SoC.

It is used to keep a certain part of the capacity as reserve for power outage situations.
