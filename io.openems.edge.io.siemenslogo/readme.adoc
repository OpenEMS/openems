First you have to configure a modbus server in LogoSoft which either accepts all connection sources or you limit this to your EMS-system Like all other modbus devices you have to configure a modbus-ID (255 is default in LogoSoft!) and a start address, e.g. 100 or use the default address 0.

If you don´t do any changes the addresses are configured as coils. In Logo! a virtual address (V) is written 0.0 which is the virtual address 0, Bit 0. For the connected device the coil-addresses start with 800 (first bit/coil), 801 is the second coil and so on
