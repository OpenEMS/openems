= EVSE Charge-Point ABL

Implementation of the ABL EVCC2/3 electric vehicle charging station for OpenEMS.

== Features

* Modbus TCP communication with ABL EVCC2/3 charging stations
* Real-time monitoring of charging state and phase currents
* Dynamic current control (6-32A)
* Three-phase support
* Compatible with OpenEMS EVSE API

== Configuration

* *IP Address*: Modbus TCP connection (default: via Modbus bridge)
* *Modbus Unit-ID*: Device address (default: 1)
* *Maximum Current*: Maximum supported current in Ampere (default: 32A)
* *Wiring*: Hardware wiring configuration (SINGLE_PHASE or THREE_PHASE)
* *Phase Rotation*: Standard or rotated wiring (L1_L2_L3 or rotated variants)
* *Read Only*: Set to true for monitoring only, false for control capability

== Protocol

Based on ABL EVCC2/3 API specification:
* Register 0x0001-0x0002: Device ID and firmware version
* Register 0x0014: Set charging current (write)
* Register 0x0033-0x0035: Read state and phase currents

== States

The ABL EVCC2/3 reports various states:
* A1: Waiting for EV
* B1, B2: EV connected, requesting permission
* C2, C3, C4: Charging (various conditions)
* E0-E3: Disabled/setup modes
* F1-F11: Error states

== Limitations

* Voltage measurement not available (assumes nominal 230V per phase)
* No phase switching support in current implementation
* Minimum current: 6A
* Rate limiting: 5 seconds between current changes
