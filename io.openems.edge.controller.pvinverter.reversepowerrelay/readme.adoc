= io.openems.edge.controller.pvinverter.reversepowerrelay

Limits pv production according to current state of reverse power relay (short: rpr, german: "Rundsteuerempfänger").
Usually rpr as four defined states which are defined by it´s relays:
- K1 -> 0% limit pv production to 0
- K2 -> 30% limit pv production to 30%
- K3 -> 60% limit pv production to 60%
- K4 -> 100% no limitation

You have to define a network input which has rpr´s output as input, e.g. a Siemens Logo!

Be careful: if there is an undefined state (e.g. two relays active at the same time or no relay active at all) then pv production is limited to 0%!
Usually only K4 should be active and your pv is not limited
